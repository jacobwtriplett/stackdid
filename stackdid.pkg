d stackdid performs a stacked difference-in-differences regression for staggered treatment 
d settings, as described in Gormley and Matsa (2011).  It offers three primary advantages 
d compared to a standard difference-in-differences approach in such settings:
d        (1) is not subject to earlier bias from dynamic effects
d        (2) can easily isolate a particular window if interest around each event
d        (3) can easily be extended into a triple-difference specification
d This method generally requires restructuring the data in memory into "stacks" of "cohorts" 
d centered on treatment events.  stackdid will create these stacks and perform the specified 
d regression.
